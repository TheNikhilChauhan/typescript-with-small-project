<h1>TypeScript Interfaces</h1>

-TypeScript interfaces provide a powerful
way to define object structures and
ensure type safety.
-Interfaces define the structure of an
object by specifying the names and types
of its properties.
-We declare an interface using the
interface keyword in a .ts file. You can also
create interface inside your component
file with .tsx extension.
-Interfaces help define a clear structure for objects in TypeScript, making it easy for different parts of the code to work together. They allow you to write reusable and flexible code by ensuring different components follow the same rules or pattern. This makes your code easier to understand, maintain, and expand.

<h2>Properties</h2>

<h3>Optional</h3>

-Interfaces can have optional properties
denoted by a "?" after the property name.

```
interface Book {
title: string;
author: string;
year?: number;
};
```

<h3>Readonly</h3>

-Interfaces can have readonly properties that cannot be modified after initialization.

```
interface Point {
readonly x: number;
readonly y: number;
};
const point: Point = {
x: 5,
y: 10,
};
```

<i><strong>-Interfaces can extend other interfaces,
inheriting their properties and adding new
ones.</i></strong>

```
interface Shape {
color: string;
};
interface Square extends Shape {
sideLength: number;
};
const square: Square = {
color: 'red',
sideLength: 5,
};
```

<i><strong>-Classes can implement interfaces,
ensuring they adhere to the defined
structure.</i></strong>

```
interface Printable {
print(): void;
};
class Document implements Printable {
print() {
console.log("Printing document...");
};
};
const doc = new Document();
doc.print(); // "Printing document..."
```
