<h1>Types</h1>

-Type and interfaces are very similar and in many cases you can choose between them freely.
-Types let you aggregate data together.

<i><bold>
Interfaces support declaration merging, allowing you to define multiple interface declarations with the same name, and they are merged into a single interface with the combined properties while Types do not support declaration merging.

```
interface Person {
name: string;
};
interface Person {
age: number;
};
const person: Person = {
name: 'John Doe',
age: 30,
};
```

```
type Person = {
name: string;
};
type Person = {
age: number;
};
// Error: Duplicate
//identifier 'Person'.
// in case of type
```

<h2>Union</h2>
-Union types (|): Combine multiple types,
allowing a value to have different possible
types.
```
let value: string | number = "Hello";
```

<h2>Intersection</h2>
-Intersection types (&): Combine multiple
types, requiring a value to have all the
specified types.

```
type Person = { name: string; age: number; };
type Employee = { id: number; department: string; };
type EmployeeDetails = Person & Employee;
const employee: EmployeeDetails = {
name: "John Doe",
age: 30,
id: 123,
department: "HR",
};
```
