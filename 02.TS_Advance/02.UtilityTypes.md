<h1>Utility Types</h1>

<p>Utility types in TypeScript are powerful
tools that enable us to manipulate and
transform types.</p>
<p>They come built-in with TypeScript and
provide useful functionalities to enhance
our development experience.</p>
<p>TypeScript provides several utility types
to facilitate common type
transformations. These utilities are
available globally</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Partial Type</h2>
<p>The Partial utility type allows us to make
all properties of a given type optional. It's
perfect when dealing with forms or API
payloads where certain fields are optional.</p>

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}

type PartialUser = Partial<User>;

//Result
/* 
{
name?: string;
email?: string;
age?: number;
}
*/
```

<h2>Required Type</h2>
<p>The Required utility type is the opposite
of Partial. It makes all properties of a
given type mandatory, ensuring they
cannot be undefined.</p>

```ts
interface Product {
  name?: string;
  price?: number;
}

type RequiredProduct = Required<Product>;

/* Result
{ name: string; price: number; }
*/
```
