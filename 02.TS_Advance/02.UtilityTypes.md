<h1>Utility Types</h1>

<p>Utility types in TypeScript are powerful
tools that enable us to manipulate and
transform types.</p>
<p>They come built-in with TypeScript and
provide useful functionalities to enhance
our development experience.</p>
<p>TypeScript provides several utility types
to facilitate common type
transformations. These utilities are
available globally</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Partial Type</h2>
<p>The Partial utility type allows us to make
all properties of a given type optional. It's
perfect when dealing with forms or API
payloads where certain fields are optional.</p>

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}

type PartialUser = Partial<User>;

//Result
/* 
{
name?: string;
email?: string;
age?: number;
}
*/
```

<h2>Required Type</h2>
<p>The Required utility type is the opposite
of Partial. It makes all properties of a
given type mandatory, ensuring they
cannot be undefined.</p>

```ts
interface Product {
  name?: string;
  price?: number;
}

type RequiredProduct = Required<Product>;

/* Result
{ name: string; price: number; }
*/
```

<h2>Readonly Type</h2>
<p>The Readonly utility type allows us to
create an immutable version of a type.
Once applied, the properties of the type
become read-only and cannot be
modified.</p>

```ts
interface Configuration {
  apiUrl: string;
  apiKey: string;
}

type ReadonlyConfig = Readonly<Configuration>;

/* 
Result:
{
readonly apiUrl: string;
readonly apiKey: string;
}
*/
```

<h2>Record Type</h2>
<p>The Record utility type helps us create a
new type by mapping specific keys to a
particular value type. It's ideal for creating
dictionaries or lookup tables.</p>

```ts
type Fruit = "apple" | "banana" | "orange";
type Price = number;

type FruitPrices = Record<Fruit, Price>;

/* Result:
{
apple: number;
banana: number;
orange: number;
}
*/
```

<h2>Pick Type</h2>
<p>The Pick utility type enables us to create a new type by selecting only the specified keys from an existing type. It comes in handy when we need to work with a subset of properties.</p>

```ts
interface Employee {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  department: string;
  role: string;
}

type EmployeeNameRole = Pick<Employee, "name" | "role">;

/* Result:
{
name: string;
role: string;
}
*/
```

<h2>Omit</h2>
<p>Conversely, the Omit utility type allows us
to exclude specific keys from an existing type, providing a type without those properties.</p>

```ts
interface Car {
  brand: string;
  model: string;
  color: string;
}

type CarWithoutColor = Omit<Car, "color">;

/* Result:
{
brand: string;
model: string;
}
*/
```

<h2>Extract</h2>
<p>The Extract utility type extracts from a union type (Type) those types that are assignable to another given type (Union).This helps us manipulate union types more effectively.</p>

```ts
type Animal = "cat" | "dog" | "bird";
type Pet = "cat" | "dog";

type MyPet = Extract<Animal, Pet>;

// Result: "cat" | "dog"
```

<h2>Exclude</h2>
<p>The Exclude utility type creates a new type by excluding all the types from a union (Type) that are assignable to another union (ExcludedUnion). This allows us to filter out unwanted types.</p>

```ts
type Color = "red" | "blue" | "yellow";
type PrimaryColors = "red" | "blue";

type SecondaryColors = Exclude<Color, PrimaryColors>;

// Result: "green";
```

<h2>NonNullable</h2>
<p>The NonNullable utility type helps us
create a type by removing null and
undefined from a given type. This ensures
that the resulting type cannot have null or
undefined as its values.</p>

```ts
type NullableString = string | null | undefined;

type NonNullableString = NonNullable<NullableString>;

//Result: string
```
